During my Mobile Application Development class, we were tasked with developing a mobile application.  In a group of three university students, all varying in skill levels, we coded features, systems, graphics, layouts and implemented sounds and music into the game.  Over the span of only a couple months, we managed to get the game functioning and published to the Google Play Store. 

Description:
Bio Battle is a free to play immersive tower defense game that plunges players into a microscopic world, defending the human body from relentless microbial invasion. As the guardian of the body's defense system, you must strategically deploy various immune towers, each with unique abilities and strengths, to defeat waves of attacking infections. With an arsenal of defenses at their command, players must strategically place towers, upgrade their capabilities, and adapt their tactics to prevent infections from breaching the body's vital systems.
